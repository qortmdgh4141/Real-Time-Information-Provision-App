4.   Real-Time Information Provision System



Since safety accidents occur at unexpected moments, it is important to check the site in real time and take prompt action.

Therefore, this project provides an information provision system that allows managers to check the site in real time.

First, after analyzing image data photographed by the CCTV camera, the following information is stored in a database.

Image of the On-Site
The Number of People at the On-Site
Safety Numerical Values at the On-site
Identification Number of People at the On-Site
Type of Event
Occurrence Time of Event
Warning and Danger Stage of Event
Then, the information stored in the database is provided to the administrator's PC monitor or application in the form of text, image, graph, etc.

Through this, administrator can check the situation in real time anywhere, not limited to places, and respond quickly to problems in the site.
